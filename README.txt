Notice that the workflow configured for GitHub Actions takes quite a long time since:
- It installs Java, mysqld and doxygen
- It also runs unit tests
- You should update it if you want to also enable Performance Tests to be executed
- The VERY GOOD THING about this GitHub Action workflow is that is able to test client/server communication, i.e. the RESTful API
